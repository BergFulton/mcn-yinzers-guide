#WDD Yinzer's Guide 2016

Usually, city guides are pretty terrible/paid for. So some of us yinzers (Pittsburghers) have put together a handy guide for Web Design Day 2016!

### General Stuff

If you're staying near downtown or the North Side/North Shore area, many of the things here will be within walking distance. If not, Pittsburgh's [bike share program](https://healthyridepgh.com) can get you there, along with the standard Uber/Lyft options. Regular taxi service, like hailing a cab, generally doesn't work. Seriously, it's terrible.

If you've never been to Pittsburgh before, make it a priority to get to Mount Washington to see the city from Grandview Avenue. We have info on that below.

If you're wondering what Pittsburgh is all about, a great introduction to the city are the [Rick Seback](www.twitter.com/rickaroundhere) "It's Pittsburgh, and a Lot of Other Stuff" videos, which you can stream [here](http://www.wqed.org/tv/watch/?series=3) via our local PBS affiliate, WQED. This guy is an institution. Or, you could just ask any Pittsburgher. Pittsburghers love to talk about Pittsburgh- it's part of living here.

### Strip District
The Strip would be an excellent place to walk around on the day after Web Design Day. It's where Pittsburgh goes to get...pretty much anything. Steelers shirt? Yep. Random imported Italian cheese? Got it. Cannoli? Boom. Mung bean pancakes? Got you covered. Come hungry.

Usually, city guides are pretty terrible. Let's make this an awesome resource for those who are in town for this year's Web Design Day!

### General Stuff
There's a ton of things going on during the weekend of Web Design Day. Two of the big things are: [Pittsburgh Pride](http://www.pittsburghpride.org/) & [The 3 Rivers Arts Festival](http://www.3riversartsfest.org/) (which features Neko Case on Saturday, June 13 FOR FREE).

If you're staying near downtown or the North Side/North Shore area, many of the things here will be within walking distance! If not, Pittsburgh's [bike share program](https://healthyridepgh.com) has just launched and you can take advantage of it to get around town!

If you've never been to Pittsburgh before, make it a priority to get to Mount Washington to see the city from Grandview Avenue. We have info on that below.

### Strip District
The Strip would be an excellent place to walk around on the day after Web Design Day. [Farmers @ Firehouse](http://farmersatfirehouse.com/) - a farmer's market - is open from 9 - 1, and Saturdays are a great day to really experience the sights, sounds, and smells of Pittsburgh.

### Mount Washington
Really, the best thing about Mount Washington is the amazing view of the city. Ride one of the two inclines to get to Grandview Avenue! | [Duquesne Incline - Lower Station](https://goo.gl/maps/20JP7) | [Mon Incline - Lower Station](https://goo.gl/maps/NfqRJ)
